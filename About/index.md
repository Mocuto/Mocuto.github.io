I go by Mocuto though my real name is Tobi Akomolede. I've started this blog as a way hopefully to share some of my projects with the world, as well as my knowledge regarding programming in general. I hope that through documenting my explorations here, I can become more thoughtful about the things that I do, and ultimately become better at them. At some point I hope to have dedicated pages up for some of the cool projects I've worked on, like my JavaScript game library, or the project management system I buit for my university's student government.

I'm currently a senior at the University of Cincinnati where I study Computer Science. Most of my coding nowadays is in Scala, though I've used JavaScript, NodeJS, C#, C++, Java, PHP, CoffeeScript, Lua, and a bunch of other languages proficiently. Scala to me is just a really fun language and I feel functional programming paradigms are the future.

Outside of programming, I'm into politics, social justice, gaming, and Netflix.

I hope you find my posts here interesting. If you have concerns something I've coded is wrong, it probably is. Feel free to hit me up!
